1\. The Big Idea

Each year, many Babson students pursue internships and jobs in consulting. One essential component of the recruitment process is the case interview. There are two types of consulting case interviews. First, interviewer-led case interviews consist of the interviewer asking 4-5 questions about a business situation to the interviewee. Second, interviewee-led case interviews consist of the interviewer sharing a more abstract business situation and the interviewee solving the situation by strategically extracting information from the interviewer. Both interviewer-led and interviewee led case interviews often have quantitative problem solving parts, in which candidates need to exercise quantitative reasoning to figure out how to arrive at an answer and use mental math to crunch the numbers. 

Our case study prep app will help students prepare for the case interview. Students will be able to run through variations of business quantitative reasoning questions that they may encounter in both types of case interviews, which will help practice reasoning, understanding business situations, and mental math. Our stretch goal is to also build out a program that takes the user through a full-blown interviewee-led case, where students will have to inquire about inputs to be able to solve the problem presented to them. This will allow them to practice the creative logic that they will need in order to be a successful interviewee, and be a successful consultant. 

2\. Learning Goals

Through this project, our group would like to learn how to:

-   Create a software solution in response to a specific user need we have identified at our own school

-   Design a friendly and aesthetic UI that is intuitive for users (HTML & CSS)

-   Build a web application using Flask (Python)

-   Build a JSON file (dictionary) that contains the business problems 

-   Create an unbreakable program that helps our users keep track of their progress, and provides feedback in the case of a wrong answer

We intend to create a finalized product that shows our mastery of python, so that we can put it in our personal portfolios.

3\. Implementation Plan:

-   Ideate 30 quantitative business problems

-   Build programs that take answers to mental math questions from users and compares it to correct answer

-   Sketch, improve, and program the front-end of the application using HTML

-   Create and test the user interface for our application wit Babson students

-   Create architecture for full interviewee-led case study 

-   Pilot it with users to see what can be improved upon final submission

4\. Project schedule
| Date | Goal to Complete |
|----------|:-------------:|
| 04/9 | Build Flask app, create JSON file with mental math, test app, fix code where needed |
| 04/11 | HTML & CSS: make the app look good for the user |
| 04/13 | Time to work on stretch goal, build out case study component |
| 04/14 | Final testing, have 3 users test the app, implement feedback |

5\. Collaboration plan:

At the beginning, we will do "Independent coding together": meet for 2-3 hours at a time to each work on components of the project, but being in the same virtual room so we can do check-ins, work through blockers together, and ask questions. 

In the final days, we can do independent code reviews, raise concerns by using Github's issue tracker, and use Slack to finalize details that don't need a meeting. We aim to check in every two days, if not daily, to make sure we stay on track and on the same page. 

6\. Risks:

1.  (Lack of) focus: with a late pivot, it will be really important for us to prioritize this project if we want to meet our goals with only two weeks of time remaining to complete the project. 

2.  Scope creep: we have many ambitious ideas for this project, but with aforementioned time constraints, it will be essential to remain focused on getting the core of the project to run perfectly and look nice. Only then, after our user testing, should we potentially consider broadening the scope if time permits. 

3.  Communication: When working with multiple people on a coding project it is easy to work on overlapping functions and processes without good communication, so by keeping each other updated on our work we can be more time efficient.

7\. Additional Useful Course Content

At this point of the course, we have learned everything needed to build this program. We also learned how to create JSON files from scratch in Business Intelligence & Data Analytics, which may be helpful when writing and storing the case studies.

1\. The Big Idea

Each year, many Babson students pursue internships and careers in consulting. One essential component of the recruitment process is the case interview: the interviewee is expected to solve a real-life business problem by strategically extracting information from the interviewer and doing mental math to crunch the numbers and arrive at a recommendation. 

Our case study prep app will help students prepare for the case interview. Students will be able to run through variations of mental math questions, getting acquainted with the calculations that are expected from them and also the business contexts that will be presented to them. Our stretch goal is to also build out a full-blown case, where students will have to inquire about inputs to be able to solve the problem presented to them. This will allow them to practice the creative logic that they will need in order to be a successful interviewee, and be a successful consultant.
