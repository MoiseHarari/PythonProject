### Kiernan - Moise - Amber MIS3640 project

There are a number of important steps to take when using the Consulting Math Suite program. Make sure to follow these instructions carefully to ensure the most effective experience with the software so that you can be well prepared for case interviews. Firstly open your command prompt and type in the command "pip install flask" if you haven't installed flask already. This is necessary for the program to run as a web application. Next, simply open the app.py file and run it. The terminal should return a link to a local web hosted server. Click through to this web address and select a number of questions that you would like to be tested on. Good luck with the practice questions and the interviews!
